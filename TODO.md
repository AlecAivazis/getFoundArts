* radium is a bitch for universal (vendor prefixes)
* DRY style
* add authentication to mongodb
* form validation
* add error pages
* a good window mock
* use history api location rather than relying on other query-string package
* figure out why there is a session id cookie being stored
* Add tasks to gulp:
    * load fixture (run script in fixture folder with same name)
    * add user/superuser
    * add change password
* these things (and possibly more that i cant think of right now) should trigger flash messages:
    - login form submits unauthorized login info
    - signup form submits invalid fields
    - deploy scripts
