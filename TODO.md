* radium is a bitch for universal (vendor prefixes)
* DRY style
* add authentication to mongodb
* form validation
* deployment
    * nginx config
    * upstart file
* add error pages
* a good window mock
* use history api location rather than relying on other query-string package
* do the equivalent of transitionTo for react-router instead of onEnter
* persist auth info inside of cookie
* figure out why there is a session id cookie being stored
* these things (and possibly more that i cant think of right now) should trigger flash messages:
    - login form submits unauthorized login info
    - signup form submits invalid fields
