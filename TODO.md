* radium is a bitch for universal (vendor prefixes)
* DRY style
* add authentication to mongodb
* form validation
* deployment
    * nginx config
    * upstart file
* add error pages
* a good window mock
* use history api location rather than relying on other query-string package
* do the equivalent of transitionTo for react-router instead of onEnter
* persist auth info inside of cookie
